1. I used blastp because we are comparing protein sequences of a mouse vs. a human, which is what blastp is meant for

2. BLOSUM62 is the default substitution matrix for blastp, so I used that. I looked into it more and found out that it
is good for moderately different proteins, which would be expected between two mammals.

3. The evalue of .00001 is good because it is strict enough to not detect random matchings while being high enough to 
capture all of the significant matches. The number of alignments is 1 in order to find the most homologous sequences, 
which reduces the processing required and narrows down on the top homolog. The outfmt 5 specifies the XML format, which 
makes the blast easier to parse for ID's and alignments.
